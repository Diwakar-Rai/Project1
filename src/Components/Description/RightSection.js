        Organic farming also known as ecological farming or biological farming,
        is an agricultural system that uses fertilizers of organic origin such
        as compost manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on
        techniques such as crop rotation and companion planting.Subsistence
        agriculture occurs when farmers grow food crops to meet the needs of
        themselves and their families on smallholdings. Subsistence
        agriculturalists target farm output for survival and for mostly local
        requirements, with little or no surplus.Farming System is defined as a
        complex inter related matrix of soil, plants, animals, implements,
        power, labour capital and other inputs controlled in part by farming
        families and influenced to varying degrees by political, economic,
        institutional and social forces that operate at many levels.In areas
        where irrigation has been possible, the farmers use fertilisers and
        pesticides on large scale. They have also brought their land under high
        yielding variety of seeds. They have mechanised agriculture by
        introducing machines in various processes of farming.In the integrated
        farming system, it is always emphasized to combine cropping with other
        enterprises/ activities, many enterprises are available and these
        includes cattle maintenance sheep or goat rearing, poultry, piggery,
        rabbit rearing, bee keeping etc.
